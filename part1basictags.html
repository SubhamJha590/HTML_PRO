      HTML History (quick notes)
      - 1991: Tim Berners-Lee publishes the first HTML spec.
      - 1995: HTML 2.0 becomes an IETF standard.
      - 1997-1999: HTML 3.2 and 4.01 expand tags + introduce CSS separation.
      - 2000: XHTML 1.0 emphasizes stricter XML-style syntax.
      - 2014: HTML5 becomes a W3C Recommendation (semantic tags, audio/video, APIs).
      - 2019+: HTML Living Standard maintained by WHATWG.
    -->
    <!-- - Semantic elements describe meaning: <header>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <footer>.
      - Block vs inline: block elements start on a new line; inline elements flow within text.
