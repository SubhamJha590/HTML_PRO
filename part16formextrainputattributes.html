 <!-- method: Specifies the HTTP method to use when sending form-data.
              - GET: Appends form-data to the URL in name/value pairs: URL?name=value&name=value
                     NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (visible in URL)
                     Length of URL is limited (about 2048 characters)
                     Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
                     GET is better for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
              - POST: Sends form-data as an HTTP post transaction (body of the HTTP request)
                      Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked
                      POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large binary data (like images) -->

<!--  required: Specifies that an input field must be filled out before submitting the form.
      readonly: Specifies that an input field is read-only (cannot be changed).
      disabled :- use to disable a form element
                      

target: Specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.
              - _blank: Opens the response in a new window or tab
              - _self: Opens the response in the same window/tab (default)
              - _parent: Opens the response in the parent frame
              - _top: Opens the response in the full body of the window

      autocomplete: Specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off.
                    - on: The browser automatically completes values based on values that the user has entered before.
                    - off: The user must enter a value into each field for every use, or the browser does not save entries.
      
      novalidate: A boolean attribute. When present, it specifies that the form-data (input) should not be validated when submitted. 
      
      The novalidate attribute is used in the <form> tag to disable built-in HTML validation so that custom or server-side validation can be used instead.-->
