    <!-- Yes, the href attribute in an <a> tag can link to images, and by adding the download attribute, the image can be downloaded instead of opened.
    download can run independently so no need of file name always 
    You can also set a custom filename using the download attribute, while the image content itself is not affected.
    If no filename is provided, the image is downloaded using its original filename. -->
