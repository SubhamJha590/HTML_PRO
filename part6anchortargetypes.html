    <!-- in this below anchor target is self(target="_self") by default when click in target 4 page by opening target4.html -->
    <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_top">unsplash</a>
    <!-- if set to parent then for this parent will be target 5 in page of target 4 but as frameset not allowed by unspash so not open here -->
     
     <!-- but if set to target="_top" then it will open in entire page when click on unsplash link or target4 page link 
      
     Yes — target="_top" opens the link in the full browser window, replacing all frames/iframes.
     If there is no frameset/iframe, it behaves like a normal link.(target="_top" tells the browser: Load the linked page in the topmost browsing context (entire window).)-->
